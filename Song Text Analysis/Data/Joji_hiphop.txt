Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Swing around front, let me inside
Playin' my song into my sides
It hurts, I can't lie
Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out
Those pictures so clear, the fade in my mind
You leavin' me here with ashes and fire
These people don't heal, these people don't feel
These people aren't real, so make me this deal
Won't you?
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
Gimme-gimme love, gimme-gimme love
When I'm gone, when I'm gone
Look into your heart and let me know
Do things turn black and gray as they go?
When I'm far too gone, can you show me love? (Ooh)
Give me love (ooh)
Caught in a river of records and dreams
Oh, will you keep up with me?
Everyone's looking for someone to hold
But I can't let you go
